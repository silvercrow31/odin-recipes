    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.webp">
    <p>Lasagna is a one-dish meal that’s very satisfying.  This lasagna recipe consists of three layers of lasagna noodles.  There is meat sauce between the first and second layer of lasagna noodles, ricotta cheese between the second and third layer, and shredded cheese on top of the lasagna.  There is also tomato sauce between each layer of the lasagna, including the very bottom and very top.  All these flavors blend together, producing a very yummy lasagna that tastes wonderful.

        For the meat, you can use any kind of ground meat, like ground beef, ground turkey or ground pork.  For lasagna, I like to use the leanest meat possible – ground turkey breast.  Lasagna is a good recipe to use the lean meat because when the meat is mixed with the tomato sauce, it tastes the same whether it’s lean or not.  So choosing extra-lean ground turkey breast is a good way to cut calories in a lasagna. </p>
